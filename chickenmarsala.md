# Chicken Marsala

## Ingredients
This serves 6-8.

* 4-5 lbs chicken breast
* 30-40 oz. button mushrooms
* Flat leaf parsley (optional)
* 3 shallots (optional)
* 1-1.5 heads of garlic
* 1-2 cups chicken broth
* 2 cups marsala wine (okay if more)
* Flour
* 1-2 sticks of butter
* Olive oil
* Oregano (optional)
* Salt
* Pepper

## Steps

1. Butterfly chicken breasts and pound to about 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into pieces that have about the area of a smartphone.
2. Mix flour, salt, pepper, and oregano to create coating for the chicken breasts.
3. Heat large skillet and put in enough olive oil to pan fry. 
* Don't put too much oil though, or else chicken will not brown well. (pretty sure)
4. Cook flour coated chicken for 1-2 minutes on each side.
* Be sure that the chicken is dry before coating with flour so that flour will bind well to the chicken.
* Do not coat with flour too far in advance or chicken juices will wet the flour.
5. Repeat step 4 until all chicken is cooked. Add more oil when necessary.
6. Add more oil into the pan and fry up mushrooms that are sliced not too thick but not too thin, minced garlic, and diced shallots. Do in multiple batches if necessary, and try to cook them enough so that they brown a little. Season appropriately with salt and pepper.
7. Deglaze with marsala wine.
8. Once wine had reduced a little, add chicken stock, butter to your liking of creaminess, and some of the flour mixture in order to thicken the sauce (if you used the perfect amount of flour for coating, this can be all the flour so there's no waste). Sauce shouldn't be too thick.
9. Once sauce is a consistency that you like, add all the chicken back in and letter simmer for maybe a few minutes.
10. Garnish with parsley.
* I like Italian parsley because it is more fragrant. Apparently, regular parsley is more for decoration than flavor, but we want flavor.

## Misc
* I have not found the need to add extra salt in the sauce when using marsala wine, salted butter, and adding flour in.
* Shallots not mandatory but definitely add to all of the flavor by giving a little sweetness, and they basically dissolve in the sauce anyways.
* Still have not perfected getting flour to bind to chicken super well.
* Might need to use more salt in the flour mixture than you think.
* Can probably use even more marsala wine.
* I have been using supermarket cooking wine, but people say that drinking quality marsala wine gives better result. :shrug:
* Goes well with linguine and other thin, long pastas. Tried fettucine once and was not great.
* Nice to serve with some Italian bread to mop up the sauce.
* When eating with pasta, I like having some tomato sauce on the side that I sometimes merge with the chicken marsala sauce and eat with some bread or pasta.
