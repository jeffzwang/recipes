# Seitan

## Ingredients

* 1 cup vital wheat gluten. I have only tried [Anthony's vital wheat gluten](https://www.amazon.com/Vital-Gluten-Anthonys-Pounds-Protein/dp/B00PB8U7Y0/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n1_0?crid=A734XQSA43CZ&cv_ct_cx=anthonys+wheat+gluten&dchild=1&keywords=anthonys+wheat+gluten&pd_rd_i=B00PB8U7Y0&pd_rd_r=2ac56617-054d-4fd0-b458-5a0a2cb34da6&pd_rd_w=LO73a&pd_rd_wg=D5a3n&pf_rd_p=d027eaac-7531-45fe-a61e-20ae30db06de&pf_rd_r=V1FN39B7JS1A4DS20RRG&psc=1&qid=1590641976&sprefix=energy+an%2Caps%2C215&sr=1-1-70f7c15d-07d8-466a-b325-4be35d7258cc)
* 1/3 cup pea protein powder
* Onion powder, wing it
* Garlic powder, wing it
* Soy sauce, wing it but probably around 1-2 tbsp
* Water, quantity depending on how soft you want seitan to be, but roughly 1
    cup
* (optional) nutritional yeast, wing it but probably around 1 tbsp

## Steps

1. Put all ingredients together in a mixing bowl and knead the dough for at
   least a few minutes. The more you knead the dough, the chewier the seitan
   will be.
2. Separate into 2-3 equal chunks.
3. Some cookings methods are simmering, steaming, and banking. So far, I have
   only tried simmmering. For simmering, I simmer for about 45 minutes in water
   with soy sauce.
4. The common wisdom is that leaving the seitan in the fridge overnight will
   make the texture chewier, but I have not done a side by side comparison.
   However, I do follow this conventional wisdom.
5. Stir frying the seitan by itself in some neutral oil is really nice. Deep
   frying is also quite good. Would not recommend eating the seitan without
   doing these things because the Maillard reaction definitely improves the
   flavor noticably.
6. Put in stir fry, curry, or anything else that you desire.

## Misc
* When simmering, make sure that the simmer is not too vigorous or else the
    seitan will not hold its shape as well.
* This is my MVP seitan - I haven't done a lot of experimentation. However, I
    think this version tastes pretty good.
* I haven't tried not adding nutritional yeast, so I'm not sure what it would
    taste like without it.
* I have also not tried omitting pea protein powder. The internet tells me that
    this gives better texture, and also it balances the amino acid profile so
    that the seitan has complete amino acids, so I just do it. Plus, I just had
    some pea protein powder lying around, so... This is my MVP seitan - I
    haven't done a lot of experimentation. However, I think this version tastes
    pretty good.
* Some recipes will say to add cayenne and a bunch of other spices. To be quite
    honest, I can't tell the difference between when cayenne and no cayenne when
    I experimented with that. Maybe worth some experimentation to test spice
    types and quantities.
* In general, there is a lack of rigorous food science about seitan preparation.
    I think such a study would be incredibly valuable to the world because
    seitan is sort of a miracle food because it's pure protein. Could change the
    mindsets of a lot of fitness minded omnivores. At least, that is my story.
* This should keep in the fridge for a long time. Probably about a week, or
    more. 
* No matter what, you should probably wait for the seitan to cool before trying
    to fry it. The reason is because if the seitan is still hot when you fry it,
    then the water in it will more easily evaporate, and when it does, it will
    combine with oil droplets to create hazardous oil splatters. This is the
    same phenenomenon as a grease fire. This is also speculation - maybe there
    are other reasons, but this seems like it checks out to me.
