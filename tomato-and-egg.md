# Tomato and egg tips

- Diced canned tomatoes are almost indistinguishable from fresh ones. Arguably
  better, unless you're using homegrown or farmer's market tomatoes.
- Eggs taste best if you cook them in a ton of oil.
- Definitely add:
    * little bit of MSG.
    *  Definitely add a little bit of ketchup.
    * Definitely add a healthy pinch of sugar.
