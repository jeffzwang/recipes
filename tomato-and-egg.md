# Tomato and egg tips

- Diced canned tomatoes are almost indistinguishable from fresh ones. Arguably
  better, unless you're using homegrown or farmer's market tomatoes.
- Eggs taste best if you cook them in a ton of oil.
- Definitely add:
    * little bit of MSG.
    *  A little bit of ketchup for extra acidity and sweetness
    * Healthy pinch of sugar (can omit if on diet)
