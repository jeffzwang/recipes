# Tritip

## Ingredients

* Few lb tritip
* Few pounds of carrots
* Bunch of garlic
* 1-2 cups red wine
* Olive oil, cooking oil, salt, pepper
* (Optional) flour

## Steps
0. Set oven to 400F.
1. Salt and pepper tritip well ahead of time, preferably many hours before.
2. Get a pan piping hot. Dry tritip as much as possible, then sear in pan until
every side is seared (roughly 10  min). Toss a few pieces of garlic in at the end 
3. Put carrots, onions, or any other veggies into bottom of a pan, with healthy
   dose of salt+pepper+olive oil. Place tritip on top.
4. Wait 10-15 min per pound of tritip. Take out when internal temp is around
   120F.
5. Bonus - pour searing juices + vegetables from roasting pan into the searing
   pan. Heat up and then deglaze with a cup or two of red wine to make a
   delicious sauce. You can add flour to the sauce to thicken it if desired.

## Misc
* You can start the veggies before the tritip, or leave them in after you take
  tritip out for extra roasted goodness.
* I like to leave the fat and silverskin on - gives nice crust.
