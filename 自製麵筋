# How to make or find Seitan (麵筋) in Taiwan
---
I just moved to Taiwan and am currently struggling to find how to incorporate Seitan back into my diet. This is my notepad that I'll update as I find out more information. 

## Where to find Seitan
---
So far, I have been told that there are [City’Super Mega City Store's](https://goo.gl/maps/ZVVTAiiookzRCAN59) that *should* stock premade seitan and other vegan options (have not confirmed this for myself!). 
I also found this [super chilli/oily seitan snack](https://shopee.tw/%E7%8F%BE%E8%B2%A8%E7%9F%B3%E7%A3%A8%E5%B0%8F%E9%8E%AE%E7%AD%8B%E7%AD%8B%E6%9C%89%E5%91%B3%E7%83%A4%E9%BA%B5%E7%AD%8B26g-i.132613223.7912369397) which doesn't seem great for being healthy haha.

## How to make Seitan

1. Find the ingredients 
You need to find a place that stocks vital wheat gluten (小麥麵筋) [I found this on Shopee](https://shopee.tw/%E5%B0%8F%E9%BA%A5%E8%9B%8B%E7%99%BD-%E5%B0%8F%E9%BA%A5%E8%9B%8B%E7%99%BD%E7%B2%89-%E9%BA%B5%E7%AD%8B%E7%B2%89-%E5%BC%B7%E7%AD%8B%E7%B2%89-i.3534891.5937708438)
The wheat gluten can either be steamed, boiled or deep fried.  The boiled version is called 水面筋 whereas the deep fried version is called 油面筋。
Then you'll also need some other filler or it may end up too tough. This can be chickpea flour, beans, or tofu depending on what you want to make.
