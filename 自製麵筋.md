# How to make or find Seitan (麵筋) in Taiwan

I just moved to Taiwan and am currently struggling to find how to incorporate Seitan back into my diet. This is my notepad that I'll update as I find out more information. 

## Where to find Seitan

So far, I have been told that there are [City’Super Mega City Store's](https://goo.gl/maps/ZVVTAiiookzRCAN59) that *should* stock premade seitan and other vegan options (have not confirmed this for myself!). 
I also found this [super chilli/oily seitan snack](https://shopee.tw/%E7%8F%BE%E8%B2%A8%E7%9F%B3%E7%A3%A8%E5%B0%8F%E9%8E%AE%E7%AD%8B%E7%AD%8B%E6%9C%89%E5%91%B3%E7%83%A4%E9%BA%B5%E7%AD%8B26g-i.132613223.7912369397) which doesn't seem great for being healthy haha.

## How to make Seitan

**1. Find the ingredients.**
You need to find a place that stocks vital wheat gluten (小麥麵筋) [I found this on Shopee.](https://shopee.tw/%E5%B0%8F%E9%BA%A5%E8%9B%8B%E7%99%BD-%E5%B0%8F%E9%BA%A5%E8%9B%8B%E7%99%BD%E7%B2%89-%E9%BA%B5%E7%AD%8B%E7%B2%89-%E5%BC%B7%E7%AD%8B%E7%B2%89-i.3534891.5937708438)
You'll also need some other filler or it may end up too tough. This can be chickpea flour, beans, or tofu depending on what you want to make. 

**2. Cook it.**

##For the my-chinese-sucks folks...
Wheat gluten can either be steamed, boiled or deep fried...the boiled version is called 水面筋 whereas the deep fried version is called 油面筋。The water from washing the gluten is essential wheat starch (澄粉。 If these starches were steamed, it will become an appetizer common in China (粉皮 or 凉粉). Another common dish is 烤夫 (which I had while on my Eva Air flight on the way to Taiwan :) )
